    <h2> Early career </h2>
    <p> Hanyu was born on December 7, 1994, in Izumi-ku, Sendai, Japan, the second and youngest child to his father, Hidetoshi Hanyu, who is a junior high school teacher, and Yumi Hanyu, a former clerk at a department store. Hanyu's father was also an adviser to the baseball school club and recommended the sport to him before he eventually chose figure skating. His mother used to make all of Hanyu's costumes in his early career, including costumes for his 2010–2011 season free skate which was designed by American figure skater Johnny Weir. She accompanied him during his training in Toronto, Canada, while his father and older sister, Saya, stayed in Japan. Hanyu's given name came from the desire of his father so he would "live a dignified way like a tightly drawn bowstring",[24][25] and also symbolizes confidence, strength, and straightness. </p>
    <p> At the age of two, Hanyu was diagnosed with asthma, a condition that slowly improved with time. The condition remained an issue for Hanyu well into his career in junior competition, and Canadian choreographer David Wilson has stated that it was not until Hanyu's transition into adult competition that he succeeded in learning to cope with his endurance issues caused by his asthma and experienced in the later parts of his performed programs as a junior.    </p>
    <p> Hanyu began skating at the age of four after his sister's coach Mami Yamada had suggested he try the sport instead of being a nuisance during his sister's training. Yamada noted Hanyu's impatience when he first got onto the ice. He came running and jumped on the ice, then fell hard, hitting his helmet onto the ice, quickly got up and running again. However, Yamada praised Hanyu for his ability to express his sincerity. After coaching him until the end of his 2nd grade in elementary school, Yamada had to move to another prefecture and asked Shōichirō Tsuzuki [ja], former coach of Japan's first World Figure Skating Championships medalist Minoru Sano, to coach Hanyu and "not put his talent to waste". Figure skaters Hanyu looked up to while growing up are Evgeni Plushenko and Johnny Weir. He also mentioned Stephane Lambiel, Javier Fernández, and Dick Button as the skaters who influenced him at the press conference of the 2018 Winter Olympics.    </p>

    <h2> Olympic Career </h2>
    <p> At the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Hanyu took part only in the men's short program at the Figure Skating Team Event for Team Japan. He won that segment and giving Team Japan 10 points. Hanyu later broke his world record and became the first skater to score over 100 points in the short program in the men's short program individual event with 101.45 points. Hanyu won the overall event and earned the first Olympic gold medal for Japan in the men's figure skating event, and only the second for the nation, following Shizuka Arakawa's gold medal in the women's event in 2006 in Turin.    </p>
    <p> On February 16, Hanyu performed a flawless short program, for which he scored 111.68 points, putting him first in that segment of the competition. In the free skate, he scored 206.17 points with a solid program. He earned 317.85 points overall, winning his second consecutive Olympic gold medal, a feat that had not been achieved since Dick Button's back-to-back titles in 1948 and 1952. On March 7, 2018, the Japan Skating Federation announced that Hanyu had decided to withdraw from the upcoming World Championships in Milan, Italy, to allow his injured foot to recover. After a medical examination following his Olympic win, it was revealed that the damaged ligaments in his right ankle and other unspecified injuries required at least two weeks of rest and three months of rehabilitation to heal.    </p>
